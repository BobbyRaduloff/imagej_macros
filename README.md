This repository was created for Martina Nuneva's thesis project.
It contains several macros that were  designed to automate the process of malaria _P. falciparum_ identification in FIJI. 
One of the color balancing macros that is included was not a product of this work, but is rather the original source from which a tailored white-balancing macro was created 
for this work.
